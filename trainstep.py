"""One DeepLPF training step, eager or captured in a CUDA graph per image shape.

At batch size 1 on a full-resolution FiveK image the step issues ~1,500
kernels, each a few microseconds of GPU work behind ~50 microseconds of
Python and dispatcher time, so the GPU idles for most of the step. A CUDA
graph replays the whole forward + loss + backward + Adam sequence from one
launch. FiveK has 16 distinct image sizes, so :class:`GraphedStep` keeps one
graph per input shape and captures each the first time the shape appears.

What the capture changes and what it does not:

* The arithmetic of every kernel is the eager arithmetic; prediction, loss
  and gradients are those of the eager step.
* Adam must run with ``capturable=True`` so its step count lives on the
  device. That path computes the bias corrections in fp32 tensor arithmetic
  rather than Python doubles, a ~1e-7 relative change in the effective step
  size.
* Each shape's warm-up runs a few real optimiser steps before capture (the
  allocator and cuDNN need them). Parameters and optimiser state are
  snapshotted before and restored after, so the trajectory is not advanced,
  but the dropout RNG stream is, so the dropout masks of a graphed run are
  not the masks of an eager run with the same seed. Same distribution,
  different draws.
