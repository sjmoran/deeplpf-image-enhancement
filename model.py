Code-to-paper map (section / equation numbers refer to the arXiv version):

* ``unet.UNetModel``            backbone, Sec. 3.1 (produces the H x W x C feature map;
                                its first three channels are the backbone-enhanced image Y1)
* ``CubicFilter``               polynomial ("cubic-20") filter, Sec. 3.2.4, Eq. 6 -> Y2
* ``GraduatedFilter``           graduated filter, Sec. 3.2.2, Eqs. 1-3, fused per Eq. 7 -> s_g
* ``EllipticalFilter``          elliptical filter, Sec. 3.2.3, Eq. 4, fused per Eq. 7 -> s_e
* ``DeepLPFParameterPrediction`` fusion S = s_g + s_e, Y3 = S * Y2, Y = Y3 + Y1, Sec. 3.1
* ``DeepLPFLoss``               training loss, Sec. 3.4, Eq. 8

The filters live in :mod:`filters`, the conv blocks they are built from in
:mod:`blocks`, and the loss in :mod:`losses`; all three are re-exported here so
that ``model.CubicFilter`` and ``model.DeepLPFLoss`` keep working.

class ColourHead(nn.Module):
    """Global colour mixer and per-channel tone curve.

    Every parametric filter is diagonal: CubicFilter's coefficients
    are reshaped to (B, 3, 1, 1) and every term of Eq. 6 multiplies that same
    channel, and the graduated and elliptical branches only apply per-channel
    gains. So no head can express a cross-channel operation - white balance,
    saturation, a hue shift - although those are most of what the expert
    retouch consists of. The U-Net can approximate them locally, which is why
    this is a gap in the filter bank rather than in the model as a whole.

    Two operators, both global and both interpretable:

    ``M Y1 + b``
        a 3x3 mixer and offset, the cross-channel term the model lacks. This
        is the Calibration/white-balance panel of a raw converter.
    ``i + sum_k w_ck relu(i - t_k)``
        a piecewise-linear tone curve per channel with fixed knots, so the
        slope on segment j is ``1 + sum_{k<=j} w_k`` and the learned curve
        plots directly. Hinges rather than a gather, so the shape is static
        and the op is safe to capture in a CUDA graph.

    Neither operator clamps. Y1 is not bounded to [0, 1] where this runs - the
    cubic filter clamps only after adding its residual - so a clamp here would
    alter the image even with a zero prediction, and the head would no longer
    start from the identity.

    Both are zero-initialised: at initialisation ``M = I``, ``b = 0``, ``w = 0``
    and the head is exactly the identity, so turning the feature on does not
    change the starting model. The layer is constructed after every other
    module so that the RNG stream the existing parameters draw from is
    untouched, and a run with this feature enabled starts from the same weights
    as one without it at the same seed.
