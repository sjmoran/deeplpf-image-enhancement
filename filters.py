"""The three local parametric filters of Sec. 3.2, gathered for import.

* :class:`CubicFilter`      polynomial ("cubic-20") filter, Sec. 3.2.4, Eq. 6
* :class:`GraduatedFilter`  graduated filter, Sec. 3.2.2, Eqs. 1-3
* :class:`EllipticalFilter` elliptical filter, Sec. 3.2.3, Eq. 4

Each lives in its own module now; this one re-exports them, together with the
shared pieces in :mod:`filtercommon`, so that ``filters.CubicFilter`` and the
rest keep resolving.
