# Preparing the Adobe-DPE dataset

This guide covers building the **Adobe-DPE** dataset used to train and evaluate
DeepLPF: the MIT-Adobe FiveK photographs, processed through Adobe Lightroom
following the Deep Photo Enhancer (DPE) protocol, with Expert C retouching as
the target. It is the path that reproduces the paper's reported numbers.

There is an easier alternative — the 480p Expert-C FiveK hosted by the
[Image-Adaptive-3DLUT](https://github.com/HuiZeng/Image-Adaptive-3DLUT) repo —
but it uses a different preprocessing and split, so it will not reproduce
DeepLPF's Adobe-DPE numbers exactly. Use it if you only need a standard FiveK
benchmark; use the steps below if you want faithfulness to the paper.

## What you need

- The **MIT-Adobe FiveK** dataset (~50 GB of raw DNG files plus a Lightroom
  catalogue): <https://data.csail.mit.edu/graphics/fivek/>
- **Adobe Lightroom Classic** (the catalogue `fivek.lrcat` opens in Lightroom).
- **Disk space:** the FiveK archive is ~47 GiB and extracts to a similar size, so
  plan for **~95 GiB free** for the raw dataset (an external drive is fine), plus
  a few GB for the exported 512px PNGs.

The raw download and the Lightroom export are manual steps — Lightroom is a GUI
application and cannot be scripted here. The scripts in `data_prep/` handle
everything after the export.

## Step 1 — Download and open the catalogue

1. Download and extract FiveK from the link above (the single 50 GB archive or
   the multi-part version).
2. Open `fivek.lrcat` in Lightroom Classic and let any catalogue upgrade finish
   (this can take several minutes).

In the **Collections** panel you will see an `Inputs` group (several
white-balance renderings of the raw files) and an `Experts` group (`A`–`E`, the
five retouchers). DeepLPF uses an input rendering as the **input** and **Expert
C** as the **target**.

## Step 2 — Export the input images

1. In **Collections**, select an entry under `Inputs`. The commonly used choice
   (from the [FiveK-with-Lightroom guide](https://github.com/yuanming-hu/exposure/wiki/Preparing-data-for-the-MIT-Adobe-FiveK-Dataset-with-Lightroom))
   is `Inputs/Input with Daylight WhiteBalance minus 1.5`. The exact DPE input
   rendering is not fully documented; Step 5 tells you how to confirm your
   choice against the bundled reference images, so pick one and validate.
2. Select all images (`Ctrl`/`Cmd`-`A`), right-click, **Export**.
3. Export settings:
   - **Format:** PNG
   - **Colour space:** sRGB
   - **Bit depth:** 8 bits/component
   - **Image sizing:** resize so the **long edge = 512 px**, do not enlarge
   - **Destination:** an empty folder, e.g. `~/fivek_export/input/`

The 512 px long edge matches the DeepLPF example images (which are 512×341 /
512×343). Lightroom preserves the original filenames (`aXXXX-<camera>.png`), and
the `aXXXX-` prefix is the image id the data loader keys on — keep it.

## Step 3 — Export the Expert C targets

1. In **Collections**, select `Experts/C`.
2. Select all, right-click, **Export**, with the **same settings as Step 2**
   (PNG, sRGB, 8-bit, long edge 512) to a second folder, e.g.
   `~/fivek_export/output/`.

## Step 4 — Organise into the expected layout

The data loader expects a directory with an `input/` folder and an `output/`
folder, each holding files named `<id>-....png`. Either export directly into
those two folders, or run:

```bash
python data_prep/organise_fivek.py ~/fivek_export/input ~/fivek_export/output \
    ./adobe5k_dpe_data --long-edge 512
```

This converts each image to RGB (dropping any alpha), resizes to a 512 px long
edge, pairs input and target by id, and writes:

```
adobe5k_dpe_data/
  input/   a0001-....png ...
  output/  a0001-....png ...
```

Pass `--no-resize` if you exported at the target resolution already.

## Step 5 — Verify before training

```bash
python data_prep/verify_dataset.py ./adobe5k_dpe_data
```

This runs the repo's own `Adobe5kDataLoader` over the `train`, `valid` and
`test` splits in `adobe5k_dpe/` and reports how many ids were paired, which are
missing, and the channel count of a sample. It also compares your exported
inputs against the bundled example images
(`adobe5k_dpe/deeplpf_example_test_input/`) — a small mean difference means your
preprocessing is consistent with DeepLPF's; a large one means the input develop
settings differ and Step 2 needs revisiting.

Expected split sizes are 2250 train / 2250 valid / 500 test. Note the splits in
`adobe5k_dpe/*.txt` are a best guess: as `adobe5k_dpe/readme.txt` records, the
original DPE splits were unavailable when this repo was written, so exact
reproduction of the paper's numbers may differ slightly from the split alone.

## Step 6 — Train and evaluate

Train (batch size 1 reproduces the paper; higher batch sizes are supported for
throughput):

```bash
python main.py \
  --training_img_dirpath=./adobe5k_dpe_data/ \
  --train_img_list_path=./adobe5k_dpe/images_train.txt \
  --valid_img_list_path=./adobe5k_dpe/images_valid.txt \
  --test_img_list_path=./adobe5k_dpe/images_test.txt \
  --batch_size=1
```

**Batch size > 1** needs a uniform image size, because FiveK images vary in
dimensions and the default collation cannot stack different-sized tensors. Pass
`--crop_size` to randomly crop training pairs to a fixed square, e.g. for a batch
of 8 with 256×256 crops:

```bash
python main.py \
  --training_img_dirpath=./adobe5k_dpe_data/ \
  --train_img_list_path=./adobe5k_dpe/images_train.txt \
  --valid_img_list_path=./adobe5k_dpe/images_valid.txt \
  --test_img_list_path=./adobe5k_dpe/images_test.txt \
  --batch_size=8 --crop_size=256
```

Evaluation and inference run at batch size 1 and are not cropped.

Run inference with a pretrained checkpoint:

```bash
python main.py \
  --inference_img_dirpath=./adobe5k_dpe/ \
  --inference_img_list_path=./adobe5k_dpe/images_inference.txt \
  --checkpoint_filepath=./pretrained_models/adobe_dpe/deeplpf_validpsnr_23.378_validloss_0.033_testpsnr_23.904_testloss_0.031_epoch_424_model.pt
```

## Notes on faithfulness

- The pretrained `adobe_dpe` checkpoint reproduces its 2020 per-image PSNR on
  the bundled examples under the current code (see `tests/test_replication.py`).
  Running it over your full prepared test split is the Tier-2 check that the
  end-to-end pipeline matches the paper's 23.90 dB / 0.911 SSIM.
- Results can drift slightly from the 2020 paper for two reasons independent of
  your data: the best-guess splits above, and PyTorch version differences
  (the paper used 1.7.1). Both are usually small.
