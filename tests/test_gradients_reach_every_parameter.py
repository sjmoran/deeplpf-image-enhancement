"""Every parameter must receive a gradient from the training loss.

A parameter that no gradient reaches is trained by nobody: it keeps its
initialisation for the life of the run while appearing in the checkpoint and in
the parameter count. One forward pass and one backward is enough to find them,
and it is far cheaper than discovering it after a week on a GPU.
